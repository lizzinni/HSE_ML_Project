# Flood probability prediction

To predict flood probability we used this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e5/data?select=train.csv)

Replace `token` in file `bot/tgbot_token.py` with your token, then run the file `bot/tgbot.py`

In file `model/flood_model.cbm` we have a fitted CatBoostRegressor

All notebooks are in `notebooks/`
